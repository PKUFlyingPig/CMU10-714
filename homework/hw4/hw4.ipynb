    "In this homework, you will leverage all of the components built in the last three homeworks to solve some modern problems with high performing network structures. We will start by adding a few new ops leveraging our new CPU/CUDA backends. Then, you will implement convolution, and a convolutional neural network to train a classifier on the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset. Then, you will implement recurrent and long-short term memory (LSTM) neural networks, and do word-level prediction language modeling on the Penn Treebank dataset.\n",

    "In order to implement the backwards pass of 2D convolution, we will (probably) need a function which _flips_\n",

    "function to avoid this. However, we think it is easiest to think about this if you have the ability to \"flip\" the kernel along its vertical and horizontal dimensions.\n",
    "\n",

    "`flip` is typically implemented by using negative strides and changing the _offset_ of the underlying array.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, flipping an array on _all_ of its axes is equivalent to reversing the array. In this case, you can imagine that we would want all the strides to be negative, and the offset to be the length of the array (to start at the end of the array and \"stride\" backwards).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we did not explicitly support negative strides in our implementation for the last homework, we will merely call `NDArray.make` with them to make our \"flipped\" array and then immediately call `.compact()`. Other than changing unsigned ints to signed ints in a few places, we suspect your existing `compact` function should not have to change at all to accomodate negative strides. In the .cc and .cu files we distributed, we have already changed the function signatures to reflect this.\n",

We suggest following our mini tutorial below to keep your implementation Python-focused, since we believe it is involves approximately the same amount of effort to implement it slightly more naively in C."
